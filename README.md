# FaceRecognitionAttendaceProject
Features:
1. Check Camera
2. Capture Faces
3. Train Faces
4. Recognize Faces and Attendance
This project entails developing an attendance system that uses facial recognition to track employee presence, time-in, and time-out.
It includes facial recognition, alignment, and identification, as well as the creation of a web application to support the system's many use cases,
such as new employee registration, photo addition to the training dataset, reading attendance records, and so on.
This project aims to be a cost-effective alternative to traditional manual attendance systems.
It may be utilised in places like corporate offices, schools, and businesses where security is a must.
The goal of this project is to automate the traditional attendance method, which involves manually marking attendance. 
It also allows an organisation to keep track of in-time, out-time, break time, and attendance in a digital format. The system's digitization would also aid in better data visualisation by displaying the number of employees present today, their total work hours, and their break time on graphs. 
Its enhanced features make it a viable upgrade and replacement for older attendance systems.
